        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>I cannot reach a website. Is it offline?</h3>
        <p>You can check if a website is offline for everyone or just yourself by using Down.com:<br>
        <a href="https://down.com/">https://down.com/</a></p>
        <h3>Is this website reliable?</h3>
        <p>I hope so. I have several family and relatives assisting me with information. My goal is to offer accurate, real information in one place. I try to always link to the websites, so you can verify sources yourself. Never believe anything you read without verification. Never send any money to any bank accounts if you are uncertain of their owners. Always do your own research!</p>
